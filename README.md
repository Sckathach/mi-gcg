# Exploring the use of Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks
Code for the blog article https://sckathach.github.io/mech-interp/exploring-adversarial-mi/.

You can check the [modified version of the nanoGCG algorithm](migcg/migcg.py), the refusal paper replication 
[notebook](notebooks/plots.ipynb) and [code](migcg/refusal_demo.py), and the 
[actual working notebook](notebooks/migcg.ipynb).

The original nanoGCG algorithm is split into the [code](migcg/gcg.py) and the [utils](migcg/utils.py).
